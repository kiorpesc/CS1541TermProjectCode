CS1541TermProjectCode
=====================

The C code for my CS1541 Term Project

It requires two files:
1. A text file to search in.
2. A CSV file of patterns.

The pattern file needs to be a single line, or some patterns will be skipped (I do NOT strip newlines).  It also should be an even number of patterns, so that replace can work properly.
